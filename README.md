Sentiment Analysis Web App ðŸ’¬
This project is a web-based sentiment analysis tool built with Python and the Flask framework. It classifies user-provided text as either positive or negative using a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of movie reviews.

Project Description
The application takes a sentence or paragraph as input from a simple web interface. In the background, it uses an NLP pipeline to clean and process the text before feeding it into a pre-trained Multinomial Naive Bayes model. This project is a great demonstration of building an end-to-end data science application.

Key Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implements text preprocessing techniques like cleaning and tokenization.

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts raw text data into a numerical feature matrix that can be used by the machine learning model.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment prediction.

Web Integration: A simple, clean user interface built with Flask allows users to interact with the model via a web browser.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Flask: A lightweight web framework for the application's front-end.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and handling the dataset.

Scikit-learn: The primary library for building and evaluating the machine learning model.

Regex: Used for cleaning and preparing text data.

Dataset
The project uses the IMDb Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews, which you can use for this project.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed.

pip for installing packages.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
(Note: Replace your-username and your-repository-name with your actual GitHub details.)

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using pip.

Bash

pip install Flask pandas scikit-learn
Step 3: Download the Dataset
Download the IMDB Dataset.csv file from the Kaggle link provided above.

Place the file directly into the project's root directory.

Step 4: Run the Application
With the files in place, you can now run the Flask application from your terminal.

Bash

python app.py
The application will start, and you will see a message indicating that the server is running.

Step 5: Access the Web App
Open your web browser and navigate to the following address:
http://127.0.0.1:5001/

You can now enter any text to get an instant sentiment prediction.
